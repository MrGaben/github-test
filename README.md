Want some wisdom?

Come and get some
I used to keep quiet
Now I'll let my lips run
Doesn't matter what the
masses think about you
Put your trust in justice,
she'll never doubt you
Thrown into a war

You didn't start one
They drew first blood
Now you draw some
Follow your calling,
listen to your heart drum
I'm the tree the apple
didn't fall far from
She's her father's daughter

With a dark side that I
could not have taught her
Caught up in politics, but
we're not fond of drama
The school of hard
knocks is our alma mater
Killing off your guards,
costing aristocracy dollars
We're wreaking chaos, a freakin'
plague's not gonna stop us
I'll get to the bottom of your evil plot
And leave you wanting a doctor
Even if you freeze me in
marble, I'll be a martyr
Covered by darkness, I
don't want any armor
When I can travel through time
like it's nothing but clockwork
I'll take your barking
dog off of his collar
And put it on ya, hook ya to
his leash and then walk ya
Are you the Godfather? You
oughtta start making offers
You're blocking me like a locked
door, guess I should knock ya
If you live in Karnaca,
you better not be a pauper
When your spoons ain't silver,
they're probably copper
Far from Dunwall, in choppier waters
Clear off your docks for
all this hatred I harbor
Dust filling our lungs,
breathing's gotten much harder
I'll kill my sister-in-law, if
that's what you could call her
Cause I'm deadly polite
and awfully proper
Corvo's gotten older but
he's off of his rocker
Touch me and I'll have your
body dropped in a gutter
And let the rats have at you
so you don't rot any longer
The hunted or hunter,
the cop or the robber
You're either the one being
followed or the ominous stalker
I mold your fate in my hands,
like a confident sculptor
But I would not call it magic,
cause I'm far from a Potter, ha!
Overseers see nothing, I can see farther
Rooftop to cobblestone,
I'm the anonymous watcher
Who want's a new constitution,
I'll be the author
Tell the Crown Killer that I
want another monarch slaughtered
You know you don't own the
throne, it belongs to my daughter
And she'll have it back if
that's my last act as a father
Cause I'm strong, but she's stronger
I guess my death will
be met with applause
Cause I'm Dishonored
(My death will be met with
applause, cause I'm Dishonored)

Could not care less so
just let them applaud
I've already conquered
I am bereft of regret, one
day when waters are calmer
I'm gonna get their respect,
by definition, that's honor!
Spare no traitor!

Lay'em down to eternally sleep
To the gallows!
Through your eyes, the world I will see
Praise your savior!
You'll run in circles when
you're searching for me
Hailed and hallowed!
I carry chaos burnin' in me
Honor! Honor! Honor!
None of you can take it from me!
Honor! Honor! Honor!
Don't care what they say about me!
Honor! Honor! Honor!
Fuckin' try to take it from me!
Honor! Honor! Honor!
Nothing's gonna take it from me!
Honor!
We've been bewitched

Stand together, deception
has no prejudice
Forget elections, like that
could have prevented this
Guess we got too comfortable
in all our reckless decadence
Pull yourself outta this rut,
you must reclaim your residence
Become a judge who doesn't
operate on pesky evidence
Cause I trust my gut, I'll shut
you up before you cast a curse
You're not the Kin of Kaldwin,
but you'll be the last of yours
She's got her father's
toughness in her heart
I can see it in her eyes,
she'll accomplish all she wants
Even in the face of chaos, she'll
fight harder than I fought
I guess the apple fell
farther than I thought
Spare no traitor!

Lay'em down to eternally sleep
To the gallows!
Through your eyes, the world I will see
Praise your savior!
You'll run in circles when
you're searching for me
Hailed and hallowed!
I carry chaos burnin' in me
Honor! Honor! Honor!
None of you can take it from me!
Honor! Honor! Honor!
Don't care what they say about me!
Honor! Honor! Honor!
Fuckin' try to take it from me!
Honor! Honor! Honor!
Nothing's gonna take it from me!

Honor!
